# Horiseon-Refactor-Model
This is my first try at cleaning up the html code.

# What I Contributed
I grouped the elements by adding a comment under section of code its assigned to first, this helped me personally to find things easier.

Next i cleaned up the heading and footer tags by removing the div element that was assigned to them and grouping the header and footer tags.

Then I cleaned up a bit of the CSS code by combining the classes (ex.benefit-lead, .benefit-brand, .benefit-cost) instead of keeping the seperate and repetitive.

Finally I changed several div tags to more appriopriate tags such as nav, section, aside, and footer. 

# What I Learned
I learned that it is important to keep the code clean and organized so that it is easier to read and understand. I also learned that it is important to use the correct tags for the correct elements.
