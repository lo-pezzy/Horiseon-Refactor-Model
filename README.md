# Horiseon-Refactor-Model
This is my first try at cleaning up the html code.
# What I Contributed
I grouped the elements by adding a comment under section of code its assigned to first, this helped me personally to find things easier.
Next i cleaned up the heading and footer tags by removing the div element that was assigned to them and grouping the <header> and <footer> tags.
 
Then I cleaned up a bit of the CSS code by combining the classes (ex.benefit-lead, .benefit-brand, .benefit-cost) instead of keeping the seperate and repetitive.
 This reduced the amount of code lines in the CSS style sheet from 201 to 133.
